# GoDDos-Html - Botnet Web Controller
> **Note**: This project is deprecated but will try to maintain a security updates. It is mainly maintained for educational purposes  only.

## üìå Overview

> **Note 2.0**: I have also updated this project so that is run on TLS / HTTPS, for that on lines 135 You will need to provide or create you own cert / key, easiest option would be via `openssl` or using `certbot` / `Letsencrypt`. And yes this is a fully working basic concept, with some example bots.

GoDDos-Html is your average web-based botnet controller written in Go, designed to manage distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks through an intuitive web interface. The system features secure user authentication, command distribution to connected bots, and real-time monitoring capabilities.

## üöÄ Features

### üîí Authentication System
- Secure user registration and login
- Argon2id password hashing
- Session management with secure cookies
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting for login attempts
- Account lockout after failed attempts

### üïπÔ∏è Botnet Control
- Real-time bot connection monitoring
- Multiple attack methods (HTTP Flood, UDP Flood, TCP SYN Flood)
- Target validation (IP/port verification)
- Attack duration control
